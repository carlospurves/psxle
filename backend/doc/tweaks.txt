There are several toggles in PCSXR to allow you to modify emulation
behavior; this may allow certain games to work that would not otherwise
function. These can all be found at Configuration -> CPU.

* Disable XA Decoding:
    Disables XA sound, which can improve game speed.

* SIO IRQ Always Enabled:
    This should be enabled for certain memcards/gamepads.

* SPU IRQ Always Enabled:
    Compatibility tweak; should probably be left off.

* Black & White Movies:
    Allows movies to be shown faster on slower systems.

* Disable CD Audio:
    Disable CD Audio for a performance boost.

* Enable Console Output:
    Dumps the PSX emulator output to the console.

* Slow Boot:
    Enable BIOS Logo.

* Enable Interpreter CPU:
    Enables interpretive emulation.
    This is often more compatible, but at the price of emulation speed.
